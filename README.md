## The Ledger Compendia app

This app is written in C for the Ledger NanoS and NanoX devices.

While the Ledger Compendia app _is_ compatible with the Ledger NanoX, there is currently no way to load a custom app until LedgerHQ releases the nanox-secure-sdk.

The Ledger NanoS is fully supported for development and flashing.

For more development resources or environment installation and usage, see the following links:
